<h1>General algorithms</h1>
These are my implementation of various algorithms, and I'm commiting them to document my progress and to also keep a backup of them. If you find
any of these useful (which I highly doubt), feel free to do what you want
with them.

<h2>LICENCE</h2>
All these files are released under the WTFPL, which you can learn more
about here: http://www.wtfpl.net/

Do what you want with them. Not like you'll actually <i>want</i> to.
